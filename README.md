2. _**D3:**_ Serves to generate dynamic graphics like interactive visualizations on geographical map & filters.
3. _**Flask:**_ Serves as the light weight web server and application framework for this application.
4. _**HTML5:**_ Used for latest feature support like consistent screen sizing and better performance.
5. _**JavaScript:**_ Serves as the basic frontend dynamic data manipulation language.
6. _**JQuery:**_ Serves as the main library supporting all the fundamental reusable functionalities across the frontend.
7. _**Postgres DB:**_ Serves as the primary storage to hold all the students academic, enrollment and geographical data.
8. _**Python3:**_ Serves as the primary implementation language for the backend which exposes HTTP RESTFul JSON APIs for student's data.
